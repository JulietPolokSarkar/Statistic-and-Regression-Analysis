# Statistic-and-Regression-Analysis
This project focuses on assessing financial risk in the stock market through an analysis of Microsoft, Apple, and Tesla stock prices from 2018 to 2023. Extracted from Yahoo Finance, the dataset includes daily stock values and the S&P 500 index. Using descriptive statistics, visualizations like line plots and histograms, and regression analysis, the project aims to provide insights into each company's performance and risk profile. Beta values calculated for each company serve as a measure of relative risk, aiding investors in making informed decisions. Contributions to the project are welcomed through pull requests and issue submissions.
